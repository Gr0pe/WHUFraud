About this project üéØ
WHUFraud is built as a learning and research aid. It provides a safe, controlled environment to study signs of academic misconduct in a manner that respects privacy and avoids harm. The project emphasizes reproducibility, transparency, and responsible handling of data. It offers a set of modular components you can reuse or extend to fit classroom simulations, policy testing, or methodological experiments.

The core idea is simple: you model a fictional university ecosystem where students, instructors, assignments, and submission events interact. You then apply a suite of analytic tools to detect irregularities, correlate signals, and generate reports. All data used in demonstrations is synthetic or anonymized. The goal is to teach concepts, not to expose real cases or individuals.
